# College-Finder

The **node modules** for this project can be downloaded using the command:
`npm install`

The contents from the **.env file** have been removed due to security reasons.
To run the project, **hostname**, **username**, **password**,**database name** and **secret key** present in the **.env file** must be assigned appropriate values.

There are two SQL files included in the project which are **college_finder_users.sql** and **college_finder_college_names.sql**.
By executing these SQL files, two tables can be created in the database which are **1. Users table** and **2. College names table**.
The **Users** table is left empty and the **College Names** table contains data of **105 IT and Management Colleges in India**.

All the data in the College Names table have been added manually from free sources so it was not possible to include every IT and Management college in India.
To solve this issue, more accurate and large amount of data can be bought from a trusted source.
